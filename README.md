# Student Sort System

This is a simple Java program for managing student records. It allows you to store student objects in an `ArrayList`, sort them by name or roll number using custom comparators, and display the sorted list.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Java programming language

## File Structure

- `Student.java`: Defines the `Student` class with fields such as roll number, name, and address.
- `CompareName.java`: Comparator class to sort students by name.
- `CompareRollNo.java`: Comparator class to sort students by roll number.
- `SelectionSort.java`: Custom implementation of the selection sort algorithm.
- `Main.java`: Main class where student objects are created, stored in an `ArrayList`, sorted, and displayed.

## Customization

- You can modify the `Student` class to include additional student details.
- Implement additional sorting criteria by creating new comparator classes.
- Extend the functionality by adding features such as searching, updating, or deleting student records.
